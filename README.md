## Metro Manila

#LockdownSuppliesMM
Hi, FB friends! I compiled (and verified) a 𝙡𝙞𝙨𝙩 𝙤𝙛 𝙜𝙧𝙤𝙘𝙚𝙧𝙞𝙚𝙨 𝙖𝙣𝙙 𝙙𝙧𝙪𝙜𝙨𝙩𝙤𝙧𝙚𝙨 that offer online ordering and deliveries within Metro Manila for my immunocompromised and single parent friends who cannot go out for supplies. I thought I'd share it in case it helps you too. I did not include drinking water and LPG suppliers as those are easier to find in your own neighbourhood. Please note that some groceries are running out of fresh stock as I type this but they will resume taking orders as soon as they fulfill the current orders.
